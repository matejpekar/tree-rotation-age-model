# Maximizing Profit in Timber Harvesting
This project focuses on optimizing selected parameters for forest management to maximize profit. *Wood* is an essential natural resource used in various industries, such as construction, paper production, and furniture manufacturing. To ensure long-term profitability and sustainability of forests, proper forest management is crucial. The project investigates two key parameters: clearcut age and tree spacing, aiming to find their optimal values for maximizing profit.

## Introduction
Forests are vital ecosystems with significant environmental and economic importance. Wood, the primary resource from forests, is used in various industries such as construction, paper production, and furniture making. To ensure forests remain sustainable and profitable, proper forest management is essential.

In this project, we investigate two key parameters: `rotation-age` and `tree-distance`. Rotation age refers to the optimal age at which a particular tree species should be harvested from an economic perspective. Tree distance, on the other hand, significantly affects the growth of trees, with wider spacing leading to greater diameter growth and denser spacing favoring height growth.

The project aims to create a simple successional forest model considering a management strategy parameterized by rotation age and tree distance. By analyzing the model's output, we seek to determine the relationship between overall profit and these parameters and identify their optimal values.

## Methodology
The forest model was implemented using NetLogo, a suitable environment for multi-agent modeling of complex systems. In the model, each tree is represented as an agent and placed in a square grid with a specific tree distance. Tree size is visualized in the simulation, with age represented by color.

Key aspects of the model include tree planting, annual growth, and competition among trees. Trees are planted at the beginning and after each harvest, with the cost of seedlings included in the expenses deducted from the total profit. The annual height and diameter growth of each tree are evaluated based on age and competition with neighboring trees.

The competition between trees is determined by considering the amount of sunlight each tree receives. A competition coefficient is calculated based on the area covered by neighboring trees. This coefficient influences the growth of each tree, with greater competition reducing growth.

To determine annual height growth, a logistic growth equation is utilized, considering the tree's age and the growth curve's shape. The potential growth is then scaled using the competition coefficient. Similarly, the competition coefficient influences the diameter growth, which affects the tree's crown size.

The model output provides insights into the overall profit based on rotation age and tree distance. By analyzing this data, optimal values for these parameters can be determined, leading to sustainable and profitable forest management.

## Results
We conducted simulations with various values of the two parameters: `rotation-age` and `tree-distance`. For each combination of parameter values, we ran the simulation for a fixed number of years and calculated the total profit generated by the harvested timber.

The results showed that the optimal values of `rotation-age` and `tree-distance` depend on the specific conditions and objectives of forest management. However, we observed some general trends:

Higher values of `rotation-age` generally led to higher total profits, as the trees had more time to grow and increase in value before being harvested.
Lower values of `tree-distance` tended to result in higher total profits, as the closer spacing allowed for more efficient use of the available land area.
However, it is important to note that these trends may vary depending on the specific characteristics of the forest and market conditions. Therefore, a comprehensive analysis considering various factors and trade-offs would be necessary to determine the optimal values for a particular forest management scenario.

## Conclusion
In this project, we developed a simple succession model of a forest and investigated the impact of two forest management parameters, `rotation-age` and `tree-distance`, on the total profit generated by timber harvesting. Our simulations provided insights into the relationship between these parameters and total profit, highlighting the importance of carefully selecting appropriate values to maximize long-term profitability.

The model and results presented in this project can serve as a starting point for further research and decision-making in forest management. 

Overall, this project demonstrates the potential of modeling and simulation techniques in optimizing forest management strategies, contributing to sustainable and economically viable forestry practices.
